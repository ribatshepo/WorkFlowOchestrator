- **Quality Metrics**: Code coverage, security vulnerabilities, performance
- **Audit Trails**: Complete deployment history and change tracking
- **Integration Ready**: Prometheus, Grafana, and alerting system support

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Container registry access (GitHub Container Registry - ghcr.io)
- Kubernetes cluster access (for production deployment)
- SonarCloud account (recommended for quality gates)

### Basic Setup

1. **Configure Repository Secrets**

   ```bash
   # Required GitHub repository secrets:
   SONAR_TOKEN=your_sonarcloud_token           # For code quality analysis
   KUBECONFIG=your_kubernetes_config_base64    # For deployment (base64 encoded)
   
   # Optional secrets for advanced features:
   COSIGN_PASSWORD=your_cosign_password        # For container signing
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Actions**
   - GitHub Actions is automatically enabled for the repository
   - Branch protection rules are recommended for main/develop branches
   - All workflow files are syntactically correct and ready to run

3. **First Pipeline Execution**
   - Push code to any branch to trigger change detection
   - Create pull request to test full pipeline without deployment
   - Merge to develop for staging deployment
   - Merge to main for production deployment
